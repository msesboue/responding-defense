    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mean Average Precision at k (MAP@k): 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A sliding (or growing) precision window, averaged over a set of query examples.
            \item Ranges from $0$ to $1$ ($1$ is the best value).
            \item Gives information about the amount and positions of positive results in the k first ones.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Binary Mean at k (BM@k):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Binary average over a set of query examples.
            \item Ranges from $0$ to $1$ ($1$ is the best value).
            \item Provides information about the amount of queries with a positive result in the k first ones.
            \item Does not give any detail on the positive result position.
        \end{itemize}
